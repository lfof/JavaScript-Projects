### Calculator
This is a 4 function calculator (+,-,*,/). You can add, subtract, multiply and divide on web version calculator.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
You can't go wrong with this classic game. You face off against the computer and when you win you are treated with a sound to indicate that you won.

### Pizza Menu
With this menu you can select the toppings and size of your pizza. I then will calculate your total based on what you selected.
